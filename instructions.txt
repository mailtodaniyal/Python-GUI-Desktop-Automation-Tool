To run the program, first install Python 3.9 or later, then install the required libraries with pip install -r requirements.txt. Once installed, open a terminal in the project folder and start the app with python main.py. The GUI will open where you can load your .ods spreadsheet containing phone numbers and audio file paths. After loading, set the dial and hangup button coordinates by entering the screen positions, choose your audio backend (VLC recommended), and press Start to begin the automated calling loop. The program will simulate dialing, play the mapped audio for each number, automatically hang up after the timeout, update the spreadsheet status, and show progress in the log window. You can stop the process anytime with the Stop button.
